This is the PiB DiscordBot Challenge0
The purpose of this Challenge is to 
allow you to get used to Python and the
Python environment which will be beneficial 
as you work on the DiscordBot.

If you are comfortable with Python then you 
can skip this Challenge as this challenge will 
involve learning basic Python Commands by completing 
a few parts.
Do not worry, there will be guidance throughout this
-as well as all others- challenges.

'''
First thing's first: Variables
Python declares variables much differently
than other "inferior" languages (cough cough..Java)
as you do not have to declare a type.
The following format is used:

VariableName = Value

Ex: (a variable to store a string/text)

PiB = "Workshop"
# this value stores "Workshop" into a variable called PiB
# when doing a string, don't forget the double quotes

'''

#Exercise: Have a variable that stores your name
#Don't forget the double quotes



'''
Print Statements are very vital as they are the 
statements that the program outputs.
This is done as so:

print("Hello World")
#this prints out Hello World
#Note that you can print strings, integers and even variables
ex:

DiscordBot = 7667
print(DiscordBot)

#prints out the value which is 7667
'''

#Exercise: Print out the variabke you just created

Now that we have covered the output, let's
cover input!
